# Dog Adoption Website

I want to improve the process/look of the website mtbr.com. It's a website dedicated to boxer dog rescues available for adoption to a caring home. I personally adopted a dog from there and felt a connection with the organization. Ideally, I will submit this project to the volunteer rescue agency to go live. I am a part of GeekCause, a subsidiary to Hands On Nashville, and Iâ€™d like to keep the ball rolling on my projects.

On the website, the front end user will be able to view dogs available for adoption. Including the dogs name, size, sex, age, pet ID, and other pertinent information the end user needs to view (such as a description of the pet's personality). For the user to adopt a pet, they will be presented with a form when they express interest in a particular pet to adopt by clicking the button 'adopt' on the pet details page. This form will then be presented to admin to review their submission.



## MVP
I want the user to be able to: adopt a dog and/or see dogs available.

I want the admin to be able to: create a dog for adoption (includes 	editing/deleting).


## Extended MVP
Full-fledged website that includes a few more pages than home, dog list, and a dog detail page. See mtbr.com for inspiration to include additional pages as time permits. 1. Pages I would like to include are: Volunteering, Donate, Support, Shop, Events, Contact, Success Stories.

User can favorite a pet to adopt.

User's 	are able to submit their adopted dog to share their pet and their progress in the home environment in the 'Success Stories' page.


## User Goals
Given a user clicks on a dog, the user see's a pet detail section that includes the Name, Sex, Age, Breed, Description, Pet ID, Location.

Given a user wants to adopt a dog, the user clicks on the 'adopt' button on the pet detail page. This brings the user to a form to submit to adopt that particular dog (see Dog ID#).

Given the admin wants to put a dog up for adoption, the admin is given a form to fill out the Name, Sex, Breed, Description, Picture(s), Location. Pet ID# will be created by the database.

Given the admin wants view available dogs, the admin can edit, delete, or mark a dog is no longer available for adoption (in the process of being adopted).
